# Python Containers & Collections Exercises

This folder contains examples and exercises that demonstrate Python container types and common operations: tuples, lists, sets, dictionaries, slicing, enumeration/zip, hashing, and related functions.

## Structure

- `containers.py` — quick runner or collection of short snippets covering multiple container concepts.

- `015_Tuples/`

  - `tup.py` — tuple basics: creation, indexing, immutability.

- `016_Slicing/`

  - `slicing.py` — slicing sequences (lists/tuples/strings) and step/index techniques.

- `017_TupleFunctionMethods/`

  - `funcmeth.py` — functions and methods that operate with tuples.

- `018_TupleOperations/`

  - `tupleop.py` — tuple concatenation, repetition and other operations.

- `019_Lists/`

  - `lists.py` — list creation, indexing, basic methods.

- `020_ReplaceSlice/`

  - `replaceslice.py` — replacing slices in lists and consequences.

- `021_RemoveItems/`

  - `removing.py` — removing items from lists by value/index and safe patterns.

- `022_ListComprenhention/`

  - `comprenhensions.py` — list comprehensions and examples.

- `023_ComprenhentionConditions/`

  - `comconditions.py` — conditional expressions inside comprehensions.

- `024_Sets/`

  - `sets.py` — set creation, uniqueness, basic set operations.

- `025_SetFunctions/`

  - `setfunc.py` — useful set functions and patterns.

- `026_Dictionaries/`

  - `dict.py` — dictionary basics: keys, values, lookups.

- `027_Removing/`

  - `removing.py` — removing items from dictionaries and safe iteration patterns.

- `028_DefaultDictionaries/`

  - `defdict.py` — usage of `collections.defaultdict` for convenient defaults.

- `029_Enumeration and Zip/`

  - `enumzip.py` — examples using `enumerate()` and `zip()` together.

- `30_Hashing/`
  - `hashing.py` — hashing basics and when objects are hashable.

## Quick start (PowerShell)

From the repository root (`d:\Cursos\Python`) or from the `Containers` directory you can run any example:

```powershell
# From repository root
python .\Containers\015_Tuples\tup.py

# From the Containers folder
python .\015_Tuples\tup.py
```
